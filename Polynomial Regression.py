Polynomial Regression
About this Notebook
In this notebook, we learn how to use scikit-learn for Polynomial regression. We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption 
and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set,
evaluate our model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value...

#Polynomial regression

'''
Sometimes, the trend of data is not really linear, and looks curvy. In this case we can use Polynomial regression methods.
In fact, many different regressions exist that can be used to fit whatever the dataset looks like, such as quadratic, cubic, and so on,
and it can go on and on to infinite degrees.In essence, we can call all of these, polynomial regression, where the relationship 
between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x.
Lets say you want to have a polynomial regression (let's make 2 degree polynomial):y=洧녪+洧랚1洧논+洧랚2洧논2 
Now, the question is: how we can fit our data on this equation while we have only x values, such as Engine Size? Well, 
we can create a few additional features: 1,  洧논 , and  洧논2 .
PloynomialFeatures() function in Scikit-learn library, drives a new feature sets from the original feature set. 
That is, a matrix will be generated consisting of all polynomial combinations of the features with degree less than or equal 
to the specified degree. For example, lets say the original feature set has only one feature, ENGINESIZE. 
Now, if we select the degree of the polynomial to be 2, then it generates 3 features, degree=0, degree=1 and degree=2:
'''

from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn import linear_model
train_x = np.asanyarray(train[['ENGINESIZE']])
train_y = np.asanyarray(train[['CO2EMISSIONS']])

test_x = np.asanyarray(test[['ENGINESIZE']])
test_y = np.asanyarray(test[['CO2EMISSIONS']])


poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
train_x_poly = poly.fit_transform(train_x)
train_x_poly

'''
Now, we can deal with it as 'linear regression' problem. Therefore, this polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of traditional multiple linear regression.
So, you can use the same mechanism as linear regression to solve such a problems.
'''

clf = linear_model.LinearRegression()
train_y_ = clf.fit(train_x_poly, train_y)
# The coefficients
print ('Coefficients: ', clf.coef_)
print ('Intercept: ',clf.intercept_)

'''

As mentioned before, Coefficient and Intercept , are the parameters of the fit curvy line. 
Given that it is a typical multiple linear regression, with 3 parameters, and knowing that the parameters are the intercept and coefficients
of hyperplane, sklearn has estimated them from our new set of feature sets. Lets plot it:

'''

plt.scatter(train.ENGINESIZE, train.CO2EMISSIONS,  color='blue')
XX = np.arange(0.0, 10.0, 0.1)
yy = clf.intercept_[0]+ clf.coef_[0][1]*XX+ clf.coef_[0][2]*np.power(XX, 2)
plt.plot(XX, yy, '-r' )
plt.xlabel("Engine size")
plt.ylabel("Emission")

#Evaluation

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

test_x_poly = poly.fit_transform(test_x)
test_y_ = clf.predict(test_x_poly)

print("Mean absolute error: %.2f" % np.mean(np.absolute(test_y_ - test_y)))
print("Residual sum of squares (MSE): %.2f" % np.mean((test_y_ - test_y) ** 2))
print("R2-score: %.2f" % r2_score(test_y_ , test_y) )


#Practice
#Try to use a polynomial regression with the dataset but this time with degree three (cubic). Does it result in better accuracy?

test_y = np.asanyarray(test[['CO2EMISSIONS']])


poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
